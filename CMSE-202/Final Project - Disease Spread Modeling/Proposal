Product Description
This will be similar to HW 3. We would start with X infected people, and observe how it spreads. Maybe follow in the path of the presentation given in class. We could make a map and transportation methods.

We are going to have people as agents who can be infected with symptoms, infected without symptoms, not infected. Each agent has a house to be in, some sort of transportation, and a place they go everyday. Each person has a X probability of getting infected from each infected person they come into contact with/in a close proximity. 

We can have different models where
people can die
the virus has varying infect-ability 
She how different levels of movement from the agents effects the spread of the virus
Let the virus evolve/people gain resistance

Existing Work
We have HW3 and the ant model

Questions
How fast can the virus spreads(plot infected vs healthy)
How different types of transportation effect the spread
How infection rates change with different parameters
We could attempt to model an actual virus

Distribution
Juuso - generating the maps
Victor - interaction of virus
David - Interactions of people
Wu - Visualization/data plotting
Note: we will all help each other

Expected Outcomes
We expect to see

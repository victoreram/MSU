If you found this, then you are on the right path! Originally, we tried to
organize things and keep code in the proper folders, but the eventual chaos of
our work has lead to this kind of organization. The "src" folder has some code
snippets in it, but then it got dumped into the Report folder. To make this
more convenient for you to navigate. The ".tex" file for the report will be in
the "Report" folder.

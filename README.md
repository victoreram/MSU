# NSCL 2017
Here lies some code I wrote simulating quantum dots.
#### Project 1: Simulating Quantum Dots using the Hartree-Fock Method.

#### Project 2: Simulating Quantum Dots using Variational Monte Carlo simulations.

#### Machine Learning Project: Simulating financial transactions of agents using Monte Carlo. 

This is an expansion of the financial transaction project from my PHY 480 project.

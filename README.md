# CMSE-202 - Computational Modeling, Tools and Techniques (Fall 2016)

HW2: Facial Recognition
Simple facial recognition program using basic PCA.

HW3: Superbugs Simulation
A model of how "superbugs", bacteria that evolve to have extremely high resistance to its environment, arise.

HW4: Election Model
A model predicting the 2016 election using polling data from 538.

HW5: Neural Network
A basic neural network model using attributes of automobiles.

Final Project: Disease Spread Model
Similar to HW3, this agent-based project models the spread of disease in a generated world.

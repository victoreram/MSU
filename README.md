# STT-301
Important code for STT 301: Intro to Data Science

### Homeworks

### Final Project: Wine Origin
In this project, I worked with 5 other group members in implementing the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to classify wine based on their characteristics. We optimized the k values by minimizing the errors and maximizing the correct classifications. We also tested the factors to be used in classification and found that testing all factors yields the best results. With the optimal k value and testing with all factors, our classification yielded an accuracy of about 96%.

This project displays some basic familiarity with the machine learning pipeline and is one of my first forays into implementing these techniques.

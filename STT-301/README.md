# STT-301
Important code for STT 301: Intro to Data Science

### Homework 1: Baseball
In this assignment, we demonstrate basic R operations by exploring the baseball dataset. 

### Homework 2: NY Crime Data
This project focuses on exploring and manipulating the data for crimes that took place in New York City in 2016. Using this data, I plotted the crime density by precinct within the city.

Libraries used: rgdal, RColorBrewer, classInt

### Homework 3: TB Cases
In this assignment, we examined tuberculosis cases by year, country, age, gender, method and region. The focus of this project was to take a not-so-tidy dataset and clean it up using dplyr. After cleaning the data, we can then visualize the data to our choosing. 
Libraries used: tidyverse, stringr

### Homework 4: Simulations
This assignment involved simulating situations and comparing them to the accepted values. My task attempted to answer the following question:
"
Conduct a simulation to answer the question below that was initially posed by Antoine Gombaud (a famous gambler in the 17th century).

Which is more likely:

getting at least one 6 when rolling a single fair six-sided die 4 times.
getting at least one pair of sixes when two fair six-sided dice are thrown 24 times.
"

Libraries used: ggplot

### Final Project: Wine Origin
In this project, I worked with 5 other group members in implementing the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to classify wine based on their characteristics. We optimized the k values by minimizing the errors and maximizing the correct classifications. We also tested the factors to be used in classification and found that testing all factors yields the best results. With the optimal k value and testing with all factors, our classification yielded an accuracy of about 96%.

Libraries used: ggplot, caret

This project displays some basic familiarity with the machine learning pipeline and is one of my first forays into implementing these techniques.

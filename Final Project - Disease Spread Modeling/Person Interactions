I(David) am working on the interactions between the people in our agent based model. We want to have people three states: Healthy, Infected with symptoms, and Infected without symptoms. Our agents will have three different locations they will inhabit: Home with their family, transportation, and somewhere "in the city". At home they will only interact with there families, and in the city they will be interacting with other agents. While agents are near eachother they will have the ability to pass on the virus to each other which will be more discussed in the virus interations. To keep track of which agents are in what state and where they are there will be a map set up for visulazation. I expect the agents to take on three different colors based on there state: Green for healthy, Yellow for infected with no symptoms, and red for infected with symptoms. The movements will opperate with timesteps, So they will have a few time steps at home, a few in transportaion, and a few in the city. Transporation will have the least steps, while most will happen between in the city and at home.

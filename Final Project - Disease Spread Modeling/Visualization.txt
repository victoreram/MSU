I(Huaiyi Wu) am working on the visulization part of this work. This visulization will be animated and looks similar to the ant model. As David's interaction part says, on the map, the locations: home, in transportation and the meeting place will be scaled and marked. The agents will have three kinds of colors to shows their status, and when they are died, a grey color will be showed in that timestep and this point(agent) will disappear in next timestep. With differnt version of the model(with evolve, getting resistance people, the color to be used will change a little with various RGB values.)There are no so many things to be assumed before we actually gets the module.
